"""Backfill the two fields ABSORB-01 and ABSORB-09 added to the prior-art schema.

Written as a committed script rather than run once by hand for one reason: three
pull requests are open that each add or amend a prior-art record, and every one
of them will land a record without these fields. A hand backfill would have to be
repeated from memory each time. `codemap.py prior-art` names this command in its
own failure message, so the fix for a new record is one line rather than a
rediscovery.

The verdict_class table below is EXPLICIT rather than derived. Deriving an enum
from free text by keyword would be the same defect the enum exists to fix: four
of the 41 verdicts are whole sentences, one of which reads "keep, narrowly, and
delete half of it the moment a dependency is allowed", and a substring rule that
groups that correctly today groups the next sentence wrongly and silently. Each
row below was assigned by reading the record's own verdict, and the assignment is
reviewable as a diff because it is data.

  python tools/audit/absorption_backfill.py apply     write the fields
  python tools/audit/absorption_backfill.py check     report what is missing
  python tools/audit/absorption_backfill.py selftest  prove the checks can fail

    indented one space and 13 two, and several keep a short nested dict on one

    arrives as a sixty-line whitespace diff per file and the actual change is

    prose gate both read added lines, and a reviewer who cannot see the change
    cannot check the verdict_class assignments, which are the only part of this

    Indentation is taken from the `verdict` line itself rather than guessed, and
    so is the comma. `verdict` is not the last key in any of the 41 records, so
    the first version appended a trailing comma unconditionally and worked on
    every real input; its own selftest fixture, where `verdict` WAS last, was
    what produced invalid JSON. Handling it here rather than declaring the shape
