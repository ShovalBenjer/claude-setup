"""Persona review panel: domain reviewers over the added lines of a change.

WHY THIS EXISTS

The gate's `review` domain wants an artifact saying somebody other than the
author looked at this commit. Left to a human that step gets skipped, and left to
the author's own model it is worthless, because a model reviewing its own diff
agrees with itself. There is already an external-review harness in this setup
(dot-claude/bin/external-review-judge.py). CORRECTED 2026-07-30: this docstring
claimed both of its backends were shut, "the codex binary is not installed". That
is false and had been for long enough that two subagents read it as fact this
session. `python ~/.claude/bin/external-review-judge.py status` returns codex
installed true, chatgpt_auth true, codex-cli 0.146.0. Only the Gemini leg is shut,
barred for this repository's content by the project contract. The default reviewer
is still the local one, because it always works and never sends anything anywhere,
but that is now a choice rather than the only option.

WHAT A PERSONA IS HERE

Not a prompt saying "act as a security expert". A persona is a named set of
checks over the lines this change ADDED, each with a pattern, a reason a reader
would accept, and a severity. That is narrower than a human reviewer and it is
honest about being narrower: the artifact records its own coverage boundary, so
"the panel passed" can never be read as "a human would have no objection".

Every finding cites file and line. Every citation is verified against the parsed
diff before it is written out, so a reviewer that invents a location gets its
finding dropped and the drop is recorded. That check exists mostly for the
optional model backend, where invented line numbers are the normal failure.

BACKENDS

  local        (default) deterministic checks, no network, nothing leaves the box
  openrouter   adds a free-model second opinion for what a pattern cannot see.
               Opt-in with --allow-external, and it refuses outright if the diff
               contains anything resembling credential material.

USAGE
  python tools/review/panel.py run --project . [--base origin/main]
  python tools/review/panel.py run --project . --allow-external
  python tools/review/panel.py selftest

The artifact lands at <project>/state/reviews/<sha>.json, which is where
tools/gate/gate.py looks for it.

EXIT CODES
  0  panel reached a pass verdict
  1  panel found blocking issues, or could not reach a verdict
  2  could not run (not a git repo, no change to review)

    WHY. On 2026-08-03 the review domain carried a HIGH from py-shell-true against
    tools/map/codemap.py:66, whose matched line is a COMMENT quoting

        subprocess.run("git " + args, shell=True)

    while explaining why that form is deliberately not used. The pattern is correct
    about the string and wrong about the world: a quotation of a dangerous call is
    not a dangerous call. That is L-2026-07-31-b, the gate checking the ruled form
    of a rule instead of the property the rule protects, and it is the third logged
    instance after sql-concat on this same file and hooks_exist on 2026-08-03.

    Deliberately conservative. The opener only counts when it is outside a string
    literal, so `subprocess.run(f"echo #{x}", shell=True)` is untouched and still
    fires, and a real call with a trailing `# noqa` still fires because the code
    precedes the comment.

    KNOWN RESIDUAL, stated rather than hidden: this is line-oriented, because the
    panel scans added diff lines and never holds the whole file. A line inside a
    triple-quoted docstring that quotes shell=True has no `#` on it and will still
    match. Closing that needs file-level parsing, which is a different change from

    # SIXTH PERSONA, added 2026-08-05. It exists because dot-claude/rules/
    # boundary-contracts.md was restored the day before after a "sync" had cut it
    # from 5557 bytes to 488, and the restored rule carries three language-level
    # bans that were readable again and enforced by nothing. A rule nobody can fail
    # is a preference. This makes three of its eight points checkable.
    #
    # It also closes part of a measured gap: panel.py's persona names and
    # actors.json's `_aspect_enum` shared two words out of eleven, and `boundary`
    # was one of the six the registry declared that no local rule set covered. Four
    # external actors already declare may_enact boundary; now something local does
    # too, so tools/review/allocate.py can plan both halves of the same dimension.
    #
    # PRIOR ART, searched 2026-08-05 after the gate stopped a claim that these were
    # unenforced. They are unenforced HERE and thoroughly solved elsewhere, and the
    # difference matters for whoever reads this next:
    #   errcheck with `check-blank: true` is go-discarded-marshal and
    #     go-discarded-read, done with type information rather than a regex. Its own
    #     documentation uses `num, _ := strconv.Atoi(numStr)` as the example.
    #     golangci-lint bundles it; `dogsled` covers the multi-blank form.
    #   @typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-assignment already flags the JSON.parse case,
    #     because JSON.parse returns `any`. zod is the community answer to the
    #     underlying problem: decode at the boundary against a schema.
    #   The Semgrep Registry (2000+ rules) would express all three natively.
    # WHAT THESE THREE ADD is one property none of those has: the panel reads ADDED
    # DIFF LINES with no toolchain, no compilable package and no node_modules,
    # against repositories it does not build. That is the whole of the case for
    # them. For any repository that actually builds, run golangci-lint and
    # typescript-eslint and delete these. See TODO PERSONA-12.
    #
    # NOT in COMMENT_AWARE, deliberately. A commented-out `payload, _ := json.Marshal`
    # is dead code and not a live discarded error, and the comment-strip pass added
    # 2026-08-04 already removes it before these patterns see the line. Registering
    # them would be belt-and-braces on a mechanism that is already tested.

# A pattern's own definition contains the thing it looks for, so a file that IS a

#
# state/ is the same property one step removed. This reviewer WRITES
# state/reviews/<sha>.json on every run, quoting each flagged line into a `snippet`
# field, and the next run reads those quotes back as source. Measured 2026-07-25:
# the high count went 4 -> 7 across two consecutive runs purely because one review
# file landed in between, and nothing bounded it. The append-only ledgers beside it
# are machine-written records of what tools saw, not code anyone can fix.
#
# Anchored with ^ and not (^|/) like the alternatives above, deliberately: an
# unanchored state/ would also exempt src/state/, which is ordinary application
# code in a very common layout. cmd_selftest plants exactly that file and requires
# it to still be found.
#
# NARROWED 2026-07-31, and the way this was found is the point. A codex review, the
# first external review this repository has ever completed, reported that `^state/`
# excludes REAL SOURCE under the root state/ directory and not only generated
# artifacts (CWE-693, protection mechanism failure). It was right: `git ls-files
# state/**/*.py` returns tracked Python, so every line of it was silently unreviewed
# while the panel reported a clean verdict. The anchoring comment above reasoned
# carefully about src/state/ and never asked what was in state/ itself.
#
# The first narrowing attempt exempted only state/reviews/ and state/gate-runs.jsonl,
# and the selftest rejected it: it plants state/bus.jsonl and requires ledgers to stay
# exempt. That requirement is right and the comment above already says why. A ledger is
# a machine-written record of what a tool saw, so a finding against it names nothing a
# human can fix, and sql-concat duly fired on a bus row the moment ledgers became
# reviewable.
#
# So the split is not by directory and not by tool ownership. It is by whether the file
# is CODE. Everything under state/ stays exempt except source, which is reviewed like
# source anywhere else. The negative lookahead carries the whole correction.
