"""Generated map of every document in the estate, with its status and its lane-letter scheme.

WHY A GENERATOR AND NOT AN INDEX. `docs/INDEX.md` is hand-curated and reaches 29 documents. The
estate holds 309. That is 9% coverage, and the 280 unreachable documents are findable only by
knowing they exist. A hand-written index is what decayed to 9%, so replacing it with a better
hand-written index would decay the same way. This mirrors the contract `tools/map/codemap.py`
already enforces for directories: the map is GENERATED, a hand edit reads as drift, and the gate
fails on a document whose status cannot be derived or declared.

INDEX.md is not deleted by this. It stays as the curated reading ORDER, which is a different job
from an inventory, and this tool measures how much of the estate it reaches.

WHAT STATUS MEANS, AND WHY IT IS DERIVABLE. The objection to recording status is that it needs a
human. Mostly it does not, because the document classes already encode it:

  adr/          declares `Status: accepted|proposed|superseded` in its own header. Authoritative.
  prd/ specs/   declare `Status:` when the author bothered. UNDECLARED when not, which is a finding.
  HANDOFF-*     historical-record ALWAYS. A handoff is a point-in-time artifact; it was true when
                written and is not a current-state claim. Marking one "stale" would be a category
                error, which is the mistake that makes people distrust status fields.
  analysis/     dated-snapshot ALWAYS, same reasoning. CLAUDE.md says several are knowingly stale.
  reflections/  dated-snapshot ALWAYS.
  prior-art/    carries `recheck_after`, so current-or-expired is arithmetic.

Only the residue needs a human, and that goes in `docs/doc-status.txt`, the same registry shape
`codemap.py` uses for directory purposes.

THE LANE-SCHEME COLUMN IS THE POINT. Lane letters were renumbered on 2026-07-30 (ADR-0016): the
harness moved from B to A, resume C to B, learning D to C, content E to D. Every document written
before that date uses the old letters and IS CORRECT FOR ITS DATE. A reader who does not know
which scheme a document was written under will silently misread `lane B` as the resume engine in a
handoff that meant the harness. `tools/lib/lanes.py` already owns the cutover, so this reuses it
rather than re-deriving the boundary.
