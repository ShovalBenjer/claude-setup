"""Structure and reachability oracle for design documents.

Two rules, both mechanical, both cheap:

  R1 STRUCTURE   every doc under docs/specs/, docs/prd/ and docs/standards/
                 declares a status
                 from a fixed vocabulary in its first 20 lines, as YAML
                 frontmatter or a `Status:` line.

  R2 REACHABILITY every doc under docs/analysis/, docs/specs/, docs/prd/ and
                 docs/standards/ is
                 referenced by at least one file that is NOT docs/INDEX.md.

Why R2 excludes the index. `docs/INDEX.md` links every document by construction,
so counting it as a reference makes the rule vacuous. A catalogue entry is not a
consumer. What R2 asks is whether anything that gets READ during work (a rule, a
spec, TODO.md, the spine, a hook, a tool) points at the document.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT MEASURE, stated up front because the gap matters. On
2026-08-03 a hand pass over docs/analysis/ found 7 of 37 documents whose
FINDINGS never reached a mechanism, while most of them were referenced
somewhere. Reachability is a proxy for absorption and it is a weak one: it
catches a document nobody links, and it cannot catch a document that is linked
and ignored. It is worth having because it is the half that a machine can check
on every commit, and the report says so in its own output.

Existing debt is carried in docs/strand-exempt.txt, one path per line with a
reason after `|`. That file is the visible, countable backlog. A new document
that strands fails the check immediately; an old one shows up in the exempt
count, which is meant to be uncomfortable rather than invisible.

Usage:
  python tools/docmap/strand.py check      # exit 1 on any violation
  python tools/docmap/strand.py report     # the table, always exit 0
  python tools/docmap/strand.py selftest   # prove both rules can fire
