## P0 — Truth & hygiene (L1/L7)
- [x] Authorize OAuth token; distribute to 22 repos (#4) — DONE 2026-07-23 (root cause: was stripping #state)
- [ ] Rotate API key still in תזכורת לעצמי group (operator) — Account id + cfat_ token still visible
- [ ] Global default model fable[1m] → sonnet per model-selection (operator OK)
- [ ] Update global CLAUDE.md "Codex is executor" line (ADR-0007 amended: Codex REMOVED)
- [ ] Purge WSL-era paths in /cdp, reground docs
- [ ] Catch docs up to reality: PRD #4 done, #8 partial, ADR-0007 Codex-out

## P1 — Deep Work Protocol hooks (L0) + digest (L4)
- [x] SessionStart recall rewired Windows-native (P1.1, deployed+wired)
- [x] Reflex router + flywheel S1 logger, PII-safe (P1.2, SLM #2)
- [x] /slop gate command (P1.5, deployed)

- [ ] RTK bash guard hook — blocked: rtk binary MISSING on Windows
- [ ] Daily digest push from cron (#6, generator+cron done, needs always-on Task Scheduler)

## P2 — Review fabric (L5)
- [x] Live review demonstrated: PR #2, GitHub-Claude caught 4/4 seeded defects + 2 bonus; session-Claude replied (two-Claude loop)
- [ ] Second model = FREE Gemini (AI Studio) replaces Codex; wire a2a-gemini bridge + gemini-review workflow (needs free key)
- [ ] a2a ⇄ GitHub agreement-gated review + provenance + audit (#8) — needs Gemini actor
- [ ] Persona review economy build (#19) — model-agnostic personas; PR-type routing; two reputation axes (persona + model)

## P-DASH — Dashboard / multi-session (NEW, from WhatsApp compare)
- [ ] Evaluate adopting amirfish1/claude-command-center (MIT) as the missing session-dashboard layer (Kanban, spawn/resume, cost, cross-session) — DO NOT rebuild (excavate-before-building). Windows-native PS install exists; Mac-first, some features degrade.

- [ ] Rules-as-enforcement per repo (#18)
- [ ] Skills estate owned/merged/archived (#12)
- [ ] Weekly self-improvement loop (#13)
