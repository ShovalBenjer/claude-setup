# Docs Index: Claude OS

Every tracked prose document under `docs/`, grouped. One TODO, one INDEX
(docs-control-plane rule).

Coverage is the point. On 2026-07-31 this file listed 22 of 112 prose documents;
`docs/DOCMAP.md` had been printing that reachability number on every regeneration
with nothing failing on it. Measured in
`analysis/2026-07-31-inventory-reconciliation-and-the-docs-control-plane.md`.
A status shown as `not declared` is a real gap in that document, not a gap here:
`docmap.py` derives a class-based status when a document declares none, which
answers what kind of document it is and never whether it is still true.

Titles and declared statuses below were extracted from the files themselves rather
than written from memory; the spine section is hand-curated. There is no generator on
disk, which means this file WILL drift the next time a document lands. That is the
open ticket, not a promise made here: nothing currently fails when it drifts.

## Spine

- [PLAN-SPINE.md](PLAN-SPINE.md): the unified plan spine. One row per live surface: PRD -> spec(s) -> current slice -> next slice -> ticket -> % built, each cell VERIFIED or marked `unverified`. Written 2026-08-17 glue pass.
- [../CLAUDE-OS.md](../CLAUDE-OS.md): single source of truth. Layers L0 to L8, deep-work protocol, native-feature map, supersession table.
- [SESSION-BOOT.md](SESSION-BOOT.md): any fresh session, full context from disk in 60 seconds (ADR-0010).
- [charters.md](charters.md): the four session lanes A/B/C/D. Letters renumbered from B/C/D/E by ADR-0016 on 2026-07-30; pre-cutover ledger rows still say the old letter.
- [OPERATOR-RUNBOOK.md](OPERATOR-RUNBOOK.md): the manual steps only the operator can do.
- [EXECUTION-PLAN.md](EXECUTION-PLAN.md): P0 to P4 harness build phases.
- [SYSTEM-MAP.md](SYSTEM-MAP.md): the whole OS scored inv-versus-need. Created 2026-07-24; several rows marked VERIFIED there are now stale, corrected in the 2026-07-31 reconciliation.
- [QUALITY-CONTRACT.md](QUALITY-CONTRACT.md): why `quality-contract.json` says what it says, per domain.
- [taste.md](taste.md): the /diverge pick ledger, one row per decision with its reason.
- [ESTATE-DIRECTORY-CATALOG.md](ESTATE-DIRECTORY-CATALOG.md): directory and repository catalog for the estate.
- [dir-purpose.txt](dir-purpose.txt), [doc-status.txt](doc-status.txt): the two registries `codemap.py` and `docmap.py` read.
- [CODEBASE-MAP.md](CODEBASE-MAP.md), [DOCMAP.md](DOCMAP.md): GENERATED. A hand edit reads as drift and fails the gate.
